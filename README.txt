These programs are exercises in Data Structures in depth in C by Srivatsava and Deepali Srivatsava. This is an underrated book. It has great solutions for basic data structure problems. 

Many works found here were copied on to works like Narasimha Karumanchi's Data Structure book.

I found the idea/difficulty transition to be smoother than any other books i have come across. Good book for someone who wants to get a clear understanding of data structures are implemented in programs.

All the best!
