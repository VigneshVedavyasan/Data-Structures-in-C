These programs are exercises in Data Structures in depth in C by Srivastava and Deepali Srivastava. This is an underrated book. It has great solutions for basic data structure problems. 

Many works found on this book were copied on to works like Narasimha Karumanchi's Data Structure book.

I found the idea/difficulty transition to be smoother than any other books i have come across. Good book for someone who wants to get a clear understanding of data structures.
